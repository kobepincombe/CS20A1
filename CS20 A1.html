My name is Kobe Pincombe. <br />
I am currently majoring in Computer Science. <br />
My IP address is: 130.64.35.18 <br />
I grew up in Ogden, Utah. <br />
Something I think is unexpected about me is my love of fishing. This, of course,
 is only if you don't know me personally and only know me professionally.
<br />
My favorite place is Snowbasin, my ski resort back home. This season was my
first one not skiing there ever since I started skiing, which makes me sad.
